The HTML code defines a basic webpage structure with a <head> element for metadata and a <body> element for the content. The content includes a <h1> element with the title "Tic Tac Toe", a <table> element with 9 <td> elements for the game board, and a <script> element that references an external JavaScript file.

The CSS code defines the styling for the webpage elements. The table selector defines the border style and centering of the game board, the td selector defines the size, border style, and font size of the individual game cells, the h1 selector defines the centering and color of the title, and the tr selector defines the text color of the rows.

The JavaScript code defines the logic for the Tic Tac Toe game. It begins by selecting the board element and all of its td children with the getElementById and getElementsByTagName methods. It then initializes the turn variable to "X". The for loop adds a click event listener to each cell of the game board, which checks if the cell is empty and adds the current player's symbol (X or O) to the cell's text content if it is. It then calls the switchTurn function, which alternates the turn variable between "X" and "O" for the next player's turn.

Overall, the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code work together to create a functional Tic Tac Toe game with a styled game board and alternating player turns.
